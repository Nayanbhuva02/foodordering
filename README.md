A full-stack **Food Ordering mobile application** built with **React Native** (Expo) and **Supabase**.
This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and deploy modern cross-platform apps (iOS + Android) with real-time database, authentication, and payment integration.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The UI in this project is kept intentionally **basic and minimal**.  
> The focus of this app is to **showcase functionality, real-time features, and clean code structure** —  
> rather than polished design. (UI/UX can always be improved as per client needs 🚀)
